# Welcome to EE 201

## Grace Gronstad
I am a current Junior, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in San Diego, CA but moved here to attend UW.
Some of my favorite things are hiking, **skiing**, petting dogs on the street, banh mis!, the beach, **hot coffee**, road trips, watching soccer, and napping.

I hope to do a lot more traveling in my lifetime, but over the summer I plan to stay in Seattle with an internship.
